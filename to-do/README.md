# To-Do App (React + Vite)

A simple To-Do application built with **React** and **Vite**. Users can add tasks, mark them as done, delete tasks, and search for tasks. Tasks are persisted in **localStorage**, so your list remains after refreshing the page.

> Note: Implementing such small projects is often asked in **machine coding rounds and front-end coding rounds** during interviews at companies like **Ola, Swiggy**, and other tech startups. These rounds test practical React and JavaScript skills.
